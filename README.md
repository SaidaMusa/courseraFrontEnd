### Frontend development

[MUSIC] Have you ever wondered what makes your favorite website so seamless and easy to use? That's the magic of front-end development. In this video, we're going to define front- end development, and we'll further explore front-end development by examining the principles that follows. Let's start with a definition. Front-end development is the practice of building the visual and interactive elements of a website or web application that users directly interact with. Now let's explore the principles followed in front-end development. Front-end development involves creating an interface for the user that adheres to some standard principles, including responsiveness, accessibility, security, and visual appearance and engagement. 
Let's examine each of these principles in more detail, starting with responsiveness. Responsiveness refers to the ability of a website to change its layout and content to fit different screen sizes and orientations. Responsiveness ensures that users have an easily navigable experience on any device, be it a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone. Front-end developers make websites and applications responsive by using a mobile first design approach. This approach involves designing the website for smaller screens initially and then adapting it to larger screens. This ensures that the website is efficient and accessible for mobile users from the start. Now that we've explored how websites adapt to different devices, let's consider another crucial aspect: accessibility. 
Accessibility ensures that websites and applications are usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities. Front-end developers make websites and applications accessible by creating interfaces that can be easily navigated and understood by everyone, including people with disabilities. This involves using clear and simple language, providing alternate text for images, or what's commonly called "alt text". Other examples of accessibility are ensuring keyboard navigability, and utilizing design with sufficient color contrast. By integrating these elements, developers can build websites that are inclusive and cater to a diverse audience. Similar to how responsiveness and accessibility enable a diverse range of users to use websites and applications, security ensures that these users can safely perform a growing and diverse range of tasks online. Security refers to the measures and protocols developers implement to protect websites and applications from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other cyber threats. 
Building secure interfaces involves a few important practices. First, ensure robust user authentication and authorization, which means ensuring that only verified users can access certain information or features. Next, secure data forms or parts of an application that get data from a user, such as a login or payment forms, to protect the information users submit from being accessed by others. Using cookies safely is also essential, as they help remember user information but must be handled carefully to maintain privacy. Finally, encryption plays a key role. It scrambles data so that even if someone intercepts it, they cannot understand it without a key. These measures collectively help make the web a safer place for users to engage and transact data. 
As a front end developer, it's crucial to craft interfaces that are responsive, accessible and secure. However, front-end development goes beyond just functionality. It's also about creating visually appealing applications that engage users. Creating visually appealing and engaging websites involves the thoughtful integration of user interface or U-I, and User Experience or U-X design, commonly referred together as UI/UX design. Let's explore the distinctions between user interface and user experience with definitions of each. The User Interface, or UI, is the set of visual elements like buttons and icons, that enable interaction between the user and a digital device or product. While UI focuses on the visual elements of a website or application, user experience encompasses all aspects of the end- user's interaction with the application, focusing on the overall feel and the ease of using the product or service. 
You might have encountered UX and UI in the context of roles typically associated with graphic designers. However, the principles of UX and UI are not limited to designers alone. Front-end developers play a key role in implementing UX/UI designs, translating design concepts into functional, interactive elements that users interact with directly. Front-end development is about creating interfaces that are not only visually appealing and engaging, but also functional. In this video, you learned what front-end development is and about the principles that front-end developers follow, including responsiveness using mobile-first design, prioritizing accessibility and security, and developing visually appealing and engaging websites and applications using UX/UI design. These principles ensure their digital products are successful and user-friendly. [MUSIC] 


### Front-End Development
Introduction
Front-end development involves crafting a website or application's interactive and visual elements that users directly engage with. To create successful digital experiences, front-end developers follow several key principles that ensure their work is responsive, accessible, secure, and engaging.

Responsiveness: Designing for All Devices
One of the most critical principles in front-end development is responsiveness. A responsive website automatically adjusts its layout and content to fit different screen sizes and orientations, from large desktop monitors to small smartphone screens. By adopting a "mobile-first" approach, developers prioritize designing for smaller screens and then scale up, ensuring seamless user experience across all devices. This adaptability is essential for creating user-friendly websites in an era where users access the internet from various devices.

Accessibility: Ensuring Usability for Everyone
Another foundational principle is accessibility. Front-end developers strive to create websites and applications that everyone uses, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. This includes using clear and simple language, providing alternative text for images (alt text), enabling keyboard navigation, and ensuring adequate color contrast for readability. By incorporating these elements, developers make the web more inclusive, allowing all users to interact with digital content effectively.

Security: Protecting User Data and Privacy
Security is a vital principle in front-end development, as it focuses on protecting websites and applications from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other cyber threats. Developers implement secure practices, such as user authentication, secure data forms, proper cookie handling, and data encryption. These measures ensure that users can trust their applications, safeguard sensitive information, and maintain user privacy.

Visual Engagement: Creating Appealing and Intuitive Interfaces
Front-end development is also about creating visually appealing and engaging experiences. Visual engagement involves designing interfaces that are functional, aesthetically pleasing, and easy to navigate. This requires a deep understanding of User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) principles, which help create intuitive designs that effortlessly guide users through the application. By focusing on both UI and UX, developers enhance their websites' overall satisfaction and usability.

Conclusion
By adhering to these principles—responsiveness, accessibility, security, and visual engagement—front-end developers create digital experiences that are effective, enjoyable, and accessible to all users. These guiding principles ensure that websites are adaptable, inclusive, secure, and appealing, ultimately leading to successful and user-friendly digital products.




### Front           
Imagine you're working on a major website launch. The design is impeccable, but it's up to you to bring it to life, ensuring that every element looks perfect and functions flawlessly across devices. As a front-end engineer, you must understand the different roles and responsibilities in creating a great user experience. In this video, we will describe the key tasks and responsibilities of a front-end engineer. A front-end engineer is a developer who specializes in creating the user-facing parts of websites and applications. Creating the user-facing parts of websites and applications might seem complicated. But as a front-end engineer, you'll spend your days on four important tasks: coding, testing, debugging, and collaborating with team members. 
To fully understand the impact of front-end engineering, let's delve into the day-to-day tasks that make it all possible. As a front-end engineer, you'll spend much of your day coding. Coding means implementing the designs and functionalities of a website or application, using languages such as Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, to structure the content of a web page. Cascading Style Sheets, also known as CSS, to style that content, making it visually appealing, and JavaScript to add interactive elements, like form validation or dynamic content loading. You'll also use frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js to speed up the process and utilize reusable components. Understanding these tools is key to crafting seamless user experiences. Next, you'll dedicate significant time to testing your code. 
Testing makes sure your code functions correctly, interacts smoothly with other parts of the application, and meets user experience standards. You'll conduct different types of tests, such as unit tests for specific sections of code, integration tests to ensure parts work together, and user interface test to confirm the site behaves correctly in real-world conditions. Debugging is another key task for front-end engineers. Once testing identifies defects called bugs, debugging involves finding the root cause of these issues and correcting them. This process often requires a detailed code evaluation, using debugging tools to observe where things go wrong and making the necessary adjustments. Finally, as a front-end engineer, you'll collaborate with team members. You'll work closely with back-end developers, UX/UI designers, project managers, and clients to make sure the final product meets all requirements and delivers a seamless user experience. 
How do front-end engineers collaborate with team members? Let's begin with how they collaborate with back-end developers. Front-end engineers collaborate with back-end developers to integrate the user interface with back-end development, such as databases, APIs, and server logic. For instance, a front-end engineer must collaborate with a back-end engineer to ensure that when a user fills out a booking form, the responses are correctly processed by the server and stored in the database. Front-end engineers also collaborate with UX/UI designers. Front-end developers translate design mock-ups into functional code. They frequently have discussions to align on design specifications and practicality, followed by iterative feedback sessions where developers build prototypes and designers evaluate them for usability and interactive accuracy. 
For example, a front-end engineer might regularly meet with a UX/UI designer to ensure that the forms buttons, fields, and colors match the designers requirements and provide an intuitive user experience. They must also collaborate with project managers. Project managers help front-end developers by defining project scopes, setting realistic deadlines, and managing resources efficiently. Front-end engineers might meet with project managers during a daily stand up or send them a quick chat message to update them on their status. Finally, front-end engineers must collaborate with clients. Clients might be internal stakeholders, such as project managers or marketing teams, or they might be external clients for whom a developer is building a website. This collaboration involves regular communication to understand client needs, receive feedback, and adjust the code based on that feedback. 
For example, a front-end engineer might demonstrate new features to clients, get their feedback, and implement changes to enhance the platform. Why all these tasks? A front-end engineer's regular tasks, coding, testing, debugging, and collaborating, all add up to one big goal: creating a great user experience. Every line of code, each bug fixed, and all the teamwork aim to make websites and apps that not only work well but also look and feel good to use. When front-end engineers code, they craft the parts of the app users interact with. They test to ensure everything works as planned and debug to smooth out any issues. Plus, their collaboration with designers and clients keeps everything user-focused. 
This isn't just about making sure the site looks good. It's about optimizing performance to ensure a great user experience. Their work directly affects how everyone experiences the web, making it faster, more intuitive, and more enjoyable. In this video, you learned about the key tasks and responsibilities of a front-end engineer. Front-end engineers have diverse tasks crucial for creating functional, beautiful, and user-friendly applications. By mastering coding, testing, debugging, and collaboration, they contribute significantly to the success of any digital project. 



### tools we use in frontend

[MUSIC] Picture this: you open a webpage and it's visually stunning, interactive, and loads quickly. Do you ever wonder what sort of skills you might need or technologies you might use to build something like that yourself? In this video, we're going to explain the critical skills and technologies required for front-end engineering. Front-end engineers need skills in coding languages, frameworks, and libraries, and using tools and technologies. Let's explore these skills in more detail, starting with coding languages. Coding languages are the fundamental building blocks for creating web applications. They consist of a set of instructions that allow humans to interact with computers. 
Front-end engineers use three primary coding languages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to build the structure, design, and functionality of web pages. First, let's explore HTML, the foundation of any web page. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Think of HTML as the skeleton of a web page. It structures the content for everything that follows. HTML is a markup language used to create and organize sections, paragraphs, and links on a webpage. Now that we've established the foundation with HTML, let's explore CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets. 
If HTML is the skeleton, then CSS is the skin and clothing that adds style and visual appeal to your webpages. CSS controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appeal, making your webpage attractive. Now let's explore JavaScript. JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to create dynamic, interactive elements on your web pages. If HTML is the skeleton and CSS is the skin, then JavaScript is the muscle that brings everything to life. Whether it's a button that changes color when you hover over it, or a form that validates user input in real time, JavaScript makes it happen. Mastering these three languages is just the beginning. 
To truly excel in front-end engineering, you also need to become proficient in frameworks and libraries. Tools that would not only streamline your development process, but also enhance your ability to build complex, high performing applications. Let's examine these critical components and learn how they fit into the bigger picture of front-end development. The terms "framework" and "library" are often used interchangeably, but they serve different purposes. Let's focus on frameworks first. Frameworks are pre-written code structures that offer a standardized way to build and organize code. They provide a foundation for building applications, making development faster and more efficient. 
Popular front-end frameworks include React, Angular, and Vue. React, developed by meta, is known for its efficiency and flexibility in building user interfaces. Angular, backed by Google, provides a comprehensive solution for single page applications, and Vue is popular for its simplicity and ease of integration into existing projects. These frameworks simplify the development process by providing reusable components and efficient state management. Now let's explore libraries, which allow engineers to control the application's flow and custom code and select only the components they need. Libraries are collections of pre written code used to perform common tasks. They often include objects and functions used individually to solve specific problems. 
Popular libraries include Node.js, React.js, and Vue.js. Finally, let's explore the tools and technologies that front-end engineers use daily. One of the most critical tools in your toolkit is a version control system. Version control systems like Git allow multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without creating code conflicts. Version control systems track changes so you can easily revert to previous versions of your code if something goes wrong. Front-end engineers also use build tools. Build tools like Webpack are essential for optimizing and managing your code during the development process. 
They automate tasks like bundling files, transpiling code, and optimizing assets. Testing frameworks are another essential technology for front-end developers. Testing frameworks like Jest and Cypress are tools designed to help developers test their code to ensure it works correctly. They provide a structured way to write and run tests, helping to identify and fix bugs early in the development process. Becoming a proficient front-end engineer involves mastering essential skills such as coding languages, frameworks, and libraries, and tools and technologies. But mastering the technical skills isn't enough. The tech industry changes fast, and as a front-end engineer, curiosity and commitment to continuous learning are your best tools for staying ahead. Following industry trends, adopting best practices, and experimenting with new tools will help keep you effective and competitive. 
This involves reading blogs, attending conferences, and taking online courses. In this video, you learned about the critical skills and technologies required for front-end engineering. By understanding and applying these critical skills and technologies, you'll be well on your way to creating stunning, interactive webpages that users love. [MUSIC] 




Front-end engineering projects have specific project stages that ensure development projects are done efficiently and effectively. In this video, we will describe the scope of front-end engineering projects and the workflow involved in executing them. Let's start by exploring the stages of a front-end development project. These projects typically follow a series of stages that include initial planning and design, development, testing, and deployment. The initial planning and design stage is where developers begin their work. They start by gathering requirements, defining objectives, and creating design mockups. This stage also involves collaboration with stakeholders to ensure the project meets users needs. 
Good planning and design ensures a successful project by ensuring everyone involved has a clear vision of the end product. Next comes the development stage, which is where the actual coding happens. Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, engineers bring the designs to life, creating interactive and responsive web pages. During this stage, it's crucial to follow best practices in coding to ensure that the code is clean, efficient, and maintainable. Testing follows development. Testing is critical because it helps identify and fix bugs before the project goes live. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing. 
Engineers use testing frameworks to write tests that ensure the code works as expected. After testing, it's time for deployment. Deployment is the process of releasing the final product to users. This involves transferring code to a live server where it can be accessed by end users. Effective deployment strategies ensure that an application is reliably available and perform, as well. At every stage in the process, front-end developers collaborate and communicate with back-end developers. This collaboration is essential to ensure that the front-end and back-end systems work together seamlessly. 
We call this ‘integration’, and it's the goal of front-end and back-end collaboration. Front-end interfaces don't exist in isolation. They must integrate with back-end systems such as databases and APIs. An API, or Application Programming Interface, allows different software applications to communicate with each other. For instance, when a user submits a form on a website, an API might be used to send that data to a server for processing. Collaboration between front-end engineers and back-end engineers often include regular meetings and clear documentation. To manage the project stages and the collaboration, teams adopt a workflow methodology. 
Workflow methodologies are structured approaches used to organize and manage the steps and tasks involved in a project. Different methodologies provide various frameworks for collaboration, task management, and project tracking. There are several workflow methodologies to choose from, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Waterfall methodology is a linear approach in which each stage of the project must be completed before proceeding to the next. This approach is straightforward, but it can also be inflexible. Another workflow methodology is XP, or Extreme Programming. This methodology emphasizes frequent releases, continuous feedback, and close collaboration between developers and users. 
XP focuses on improving software quality and responsiveness to changing requirements. Agile methodology, however, is particularly popular in front-end engineering. Agile is an iterative approach that promotes flexibility and customer collaboration. In Agile, projects are divided into smaller, manageable chunks called sprints, typically lasting two to four weeks. At the end of each sprint, the team reviews progress and plans the next steps. Agile methodologies allow front-end engineers to adapt quickly to changes and continuously improve their work based on feedback. To manage the project stages efficiently and develop an excellent product, front-end engineers follow some best practices. 
First, front-end engineers must prioritize their tasks. They organize tasks based on their importance and deadlines. They use project management tools like JIRA, Trello, or Asana to help manage and prioritize tasks efficiently. They also use version control tools to manage code changes and collaborate effectively. Code reviews are another important practice. Code reviews involve having other developers review your code to catch errors, improve code quality, and share knowledge with the team. This enables engineers to maintain code quality and share knowledge among team members. 
Finally, they implement deployment strategies such as continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines, CI/CD, to automate the deployment process. This ensures that updates are deployed frequently and reliably. In this video, you learned about the scope of front-end engineering projects and some key best practices for workflow management. Understanding the scope and workflow of front-end engineering projects is critical for delivering high quality web applications. By following structured project stages, collaborating with back-end engineers to seamlessly integrate with back-end systems, and adhering to best practices, front-end engineers can create efficient, user friendly, and robust applications.

Engineers use testing frameworks to write tests that ensure the code works as expected. After testing, it's time for deployment. Deployment is the process of releasing the final product to users. This involves transferring code to a live server where it can be accessed by end users. Effective deployment strategies ensure that an application is reliably available and perform, as well. At every stage in the process, front-end developers collaborate and communicate with back-end developers. This collaboration is essential to ensure that the front-end and back-end systems work together seamlessly.  We call this ‘integration’, and it's the goal of front-end and back-end collaboration. Front-end interfaces don't exist in isolation. They must integrate with back-end systems such as databases and APIs. An API, or Application Programming Interface, allows different software applications to communicate with each other. For instance, when a user submits a form on a website, an API might be used to send that data to a server for processing. Collaboration between front-end engineers and back-end engineers often include regular meetings and clear documentation. To manage the project stages and the collaboration, teams adopt a workflow methodology.  Workflow methodologies are structured approaches used to organize and manage the steps and tasks involved in a project. Different methodologies provide various frameworks for collaboration, task management, and project tracking. There are several workflow methodologies to choose from, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Waterfall methodology is a linear approach in which each stage of the project must be completed before proceeding to the next. This approach is straightforward, but it can also be inflexible. Another workflow methodology is XP, or Extreme Programming. This methodology emphasizes frequent releases, continuous feedback, and close collaboration between developers and users.  XP focuses on improving software quality and responsiveness to changing requirements. Agile methodology, however, is particularly popular in front-end engineering. Agile is an iterative approach that promotes flexibility and customer collaboration. In Agile, projects are divided into smaller, manageable chunks called sprints, typically lasting two to four weeks. At the end of each sprint, the team reviews progress and plans the next steps. Agile methodologies allow front-end engineers to adapt quickly to changes and continuously improve their work based on feedback. To manage the project stages efficiently and develop an excellent product, front-end engineers follow some best practices.  First, front-end engineers must prioritize their tasks. They organize tasks based on their importance and deadlines. They use project management tools like JIRA, Trello, or Asana to help manage and prioritize tasks efficiently. They also use version control tools to manage code changes and collaborate effectively. Code reviews are another important practice. Code reviews involve having other developers review your code to catch errors, improve code quality, and share knowledge with the team. This enables engineers to maintain code quality and share knowledge among team members.  Finally, they implement deployment strategies such as continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines, CI/CD, to automate the deployment process. This ensures that updates are deployed frequently and reliably. In this video, you learned about the scope of front-end engineering projects and some key best practices for workflow management. Understanding the scope and workflow of front-end engineering projects is critical for delivering high quality web applications. By following structured project stages, collaborating with back-end engineers to seamlessly integrate with back-end systems, and adhering to best practices, front-end engineers can create efficient, user friendly, and robust applications.

Front-end engineering projects have specific project stages that ensure development projects are done efficiently and effectively. In this video, we will describe the scope of front-end engineering projects and the workflow involved in executing them. Let's start by exploring the stages of a front-end development project. These projects typically follow a series of stages that include initial planning and design, development, testing, and deployment. The initial planning and design stage is where developers begin their work. They start by gathering requirements, defining objectives, and creating design mockups. This stage also involves collaboration with stakeholders to ensure the project meets users needs. 
Good planning and design ensures a successful project by ensuring everyone involved has a clear vision of the end product. Next comes the development stage, which is where the actual coding happens. Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, engineers bring the designs to life, creating interactive and responsive web pages. During this stage, it's crucial to follow best practices in coding to ensure that the code is clean, efficient, and maintainable. Testing follows development. Testing is critical because it helps identify and fix bugs before the project goes live. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.

### git basics
Ever lost work or struggled to collaborate on a project, enter Git, the lifesaver of coding. This powerful version control system keeps track of every change, making teamwork smooth and mistakes fixable. In this video, we will describe the basics of Git commands, and their uses in front end development. Let's start by reviewing the benefits of version control. Version control is essential because it tracks all changes made to the code, allows developers to collaborate, enables easy reversion to previous versions, and lets developers work a new features or fixes, without affecting the main code base. Though there are other version control systems, Git is the one that's most widely used. Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes, collaborate, and maintain the history of their code. 
Think of Git as one of the essential tools every developer needs, like brushes and palettes to a painter, which helps them create and manage different versions of their work. In contrast, GitHub is like an art gallery where artists store their pieces, showcase their work, and collaborate with other artists. How does get enable developers to maintain the history of their code, track changes, and collaborate? Git involves the use of repositories and branching. Let's examine how Git uses both of these strategies. In Git, a repository is a storage space where all files related to a project are kept, including their complete change history. These repositories hold snapshots of all code versions, allowing developers to track changes, maintain a history, and roll back to a previous version, if necessary. 
Next, let's explore branching. If you think of the main code as the main branch, developers create other branches when they need to add new code or make changes to the existing code. Think of branching like making a copy of a folder. When a new branch is created, it's like making a copy. Developers can add to, modify, and test these documents in this copy, without impacting the original. Once they're sure their edits are correct and stable, they can merge the changes into the folder back into the main branch, updating it with all the new modifications. Developers use repositories and branching to manage their code with the help of Git in GitHub. 
But how do developers interact with these tools? They execute commands. Developers execute commands typically through an application like GitHub or Visual Studio Code. Some of the basic commands developers use include clone, branch, commit, push, and pull. Let's explore each of these commands in detail, starting with clone. The clone command creates a local copy of the repository a developer is working on. This allows them to start working with the code base on their own machine. 
To use the clone command, you would type git, space, clone, space, then the URL of the repository. For instance, if you're developing a new feature for the shopping cart user interface on an e-commerce website, you would first clone the existing project. Next, you need to create a branch using the branch command. The branch command allows developers to create a new branch to work on a specific feature or fix. Working on branches keeps the main code base stable. To use the branch command, you would type git, space, branch, space, then the name of the branch. For your shopping cart user interface feature, you might create a branch by using the command git branch feature-shopping-cart-ui. 
With a copy of the repository on your local machine and a branch created, you're now ready to get started on the development work. Once you write some code or make some code changes to the existing code, you will commit your code. The commit command captures a snapshot of the project's changes. This allows you to track your progress and revert to a previous version if needed. To use the commit command, you would type git, space, commit, space, -m, then a commit message in quotes. Notice that the commit command includes the commit message. This is where a developer writes a meaningful message to describe what changes were made to the code base. 
For example, after creating the basic layout for the shopping cart, you might commit with the message, initialized shopping cart layout. When you're done with all of your changes, you use the push command. The push command updates the remote repository with local changes, allowing others to review and use updates. To use the push command, you would type git, space, push, space, then the name of the remote repository, and finally, the branch name. Once you're satisfied with the development and testing of your new shopping cart feature, the next step is to share your work by pushing it to GitHub. You execute the command git push origin feature-shopping-cart-ui, which uploads all commands from your local branch named feature-shopping-cart-ui to GitHub. Now you're ready to start working on the next feature so you could execute a pull command. 
The pull command updates your local code base with the latest changes from the remote repository, ensuring you have the most current version. To use the pull command, you would type git, space, pull, space, then the name of the remote repository, and finally, the branch name. You use the pull command git pull origin main, to pull down the latest version of the code in the repository. After pulling the latest updates, you can go back and use the branch command. This will create a new branch from the updated main branch, so you can start working on your next feature. This workflow maintains the integrity and continuity of the project, allowing all developers to work collaboratively and efficiently. In this video, you learn some of the basic Git commands and their uses in the development process. 
By mastering basic Git commands such as clone, branch, commit, push, and pull, developers can effectively manage their code, collaborate with their team, and maintain a comprehensive history of their projects. This leads to a more organized and efficient development process.
